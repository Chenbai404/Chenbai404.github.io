# 1.1 Goodness-of-fit chi-square test    
  
**Step1: make assumption**
> For example, there are 10 packages suger and 5 flavors, in addition, each package has 100 suger.  
> Assumpt each package has same flavors.    
> The significance level Î± was set at 0.05    
    
**Note:the 0.05 also can be understanded:    
  We are willing to take a 5% risk of reaching an incorrect conclusion     
  (i.e., that the flavour counts of each packet of sweets are not equal when they are in fact equal across the whole aggregate)**  
  
**Step2:Calculate the test statistic**    
**Step3:Find the theoretical value from the chi-square distribution according to the level of significance**  
> For this step, you can check the table or code by formulas.  
  
**Step4:Compare the value of the test statistic with the chi-square value**  
> if  test statistic > chi-square value : reject  
> if  test statistic <= chi-square value : agree
