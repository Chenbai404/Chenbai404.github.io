# Skill  



# Usually using function  
## Python  
**1. creat a empty list:**  
>a = [] or list()
  

**2. add a item into the end of list:**  
>listname.append(item)  
  
  
**3. using str(number) to transfer number into string:**
>a = 123
>b = str(1)
>print(b) will get '123'
  

**4. for i in range(min,max):**  
>the part of 'range' can be replaced by string, and it will start at first letter from the string.
>so ,don`t need to make a string list and then to account its length.
>>e.g. for i in range(0, length(string))
>>rather than
>>'code to trans string into list' and then range(0, length(string))
